# OpenImages-Yolo-converter
Python program to convert OpenImages (V4/V5) labels to be used for YOLOv3. The program is a more efficient version (15x faster) than [the repository by Karol Majek.](https://github.com/karolmajek/YoloV3-Open-Images-v4). 

The program can be used to train either for all the 600 classes or for few classes (for custom object detection models).

## Requisites
* Download the annotation .csv files as well as the class description .csv file.

* Download the images from the OpenImages dataset. For one or few classes, check [this repository.](https://github.com/EscVM/OIDv4_ToolKit)
